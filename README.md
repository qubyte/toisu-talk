# toisu-talk

A talk about async-await and [Toisu!](https://github.com/qubyte/toisu) given at the Brighton JavaScript user group (asyncjs) in December 2015. It uses Toisu!, with static file serving and server sent events on the server side (I wrote a pebble watch companion app to act as a remote), and flexbox on the client side. I'm happy with how it worked out.

Adapt at your own risk! Slides are written in template tags, which is probably an abuse of the feature.
